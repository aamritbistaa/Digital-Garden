after giving more than 10+ interview and written test as developer for internship, i want to suggest all the people who applying for internship first time and some tips also for who hasn't been shortlist for interview or first round. This
will be on my personal experience so it might differ from person or person.
either you apply as react js , vue js or angular mainly javascript frontend or node js mostly questions will asked javascript basic like array,object,prototype,callback,function , classes etc, so never make mistake to aviod java script basic be confident as theory and practical ,
if you applied frontend then you should cover html and css questions most common questions are, symantic html, doctype html, diff. between block and inline element etc, and css , peudoclass,slectors,boxmodel,flex-box etc. if u thinking that i was thought before will they ask also css frame works like tailwind, bootsrap etc then till that day i havnt seen qny questions about css frame works , at least which css frame work do u use and why can be asked sometime.
in written test, if you selected for written test than you will confuse what will be written test? then simply written test is like exam where you write code in copy and questions will be subjective as well as objective (MCQS) and also tricky questions like CMAT,
and 3 most common question , 1st why you want to join us? 2nd goal with in 5 years, 3rd your strength and weakness .. so this 3 questions is common so be ready.
My friends and me applying many times and he got rejected i mean not shortlist but i was selected so hw asked me whY?
the answer is proper cv and cover letter, so make projects and upload github and link your cv interviewer maybe not check but never miss to describe your project suppose if u build e commerce app then define which frameworks use for frontend and backend,
how you mange states so etc etc .. because interviewer ask you about this project while they taking interview so dont copy other project and push ur github. if you are facing problems making cv then search sajilo cv and build
Next is Cover letter so writing
cover letter is not difficult just go to chat gpt and command write cv for internship as react js [write position you applying for] and copy and paste as you own,
this is my experience after getting more and more rejection from interviews
keep applying and keep coding




--------------
Question:
- You will be asked about Async / Sync or Blocking / Non-blocking and the whole idea is to understand if you know how JavaScript works? This question has many form too, if they directly ask you about it, that's fine but sometimes they might show you a code snippet and ask you to explain.
An example will be,
setTimeout(() => console.log('hello'), 0);
console.log('there');
Output:
"there"
"hello"
explain this?
- Difference between null & undefined?
- Closure
- Event loop & Callback queue ( Same as question 1 ).
Based on the company, they might ask you some DSA questions. I haven't experienced any algorithm questions yet but about data structure, it is more likely to be asked.
From Algorithms, you can expect string manipulation questions normally.
From Data Structure, you can expect questions from Array and Hash Tables most of the time.
I have experienced Hash Table question in one interview.
The benefit of JavaScript is, JavaScript objects are Hash Tables and it's easy for you to implement in less time.
More than your core knowledge and computer fundamentals like Data Structure and Algorithms, companies are looking for candidates who are experienced with specific technologies they use.
Don't worry about DSA questions because they are mostly asked in companies that focuses on SaaS product. Also, they are asked for the candidate applying for internship in their final year most of the time.
React questions:
- Virtual DOM
- React Hooks
- React life-cycle
- Context API
- Props drilling
- Difference between props and state
Question related to REST API, OOP is expected based on what you put on your resume.
So, what does Seniority / Behavioral interview looks like?
Some question in this interview can also be called as non-technical interview questions.
- Questions related to Agile.
- How will you handle multiple projects at a time?
- If you have a conflict with your colleague, how will you handle? Or if you are a team leader and find two colleague in a conflict? How will you handle?
- Let us suppose, you have a sprint plan assigned to the your best team, all the tasks are done but except one and the delivery date has arrived, how will you handle it? Once resolved, what will be your step to prevent it on future?
- If you were to lead a project, what will be your plan from beginning to the delivery?
- Which one do you prefer? git re-base or git merge? If you answer anyone of them, the question will be followed by, let's us suppose if the team is comfortable with <the opposite of your answer> and what will be your take on this?
Well, I am really trying to recall the questions but these are similar questions I was asked for.
Normally, this is how the interviews looks like and what I have mentioned above is a mixed experience of many companies. So, you cannot expect to be asked all the above question by a single company, the interview process might look too long but it doesn't really. Normally the maximum time is 1 hr it can take.
The negotiation round is simple,
They will ask you the salary, if it is okay for them nothing much to do. If not, they might ask some questions. In my case:
- You know the expected salary is quit huge in the context of Nepal, so was there any research involved from your side that it is possible to get paid or because you have seen people getting paid huge amount outside Nepal.
I was asked this question and you need to be really honest regarding it. Don't just throw up whatever you want, be honest and negotiate properly. If you can convince them, well that's good for you.
The HR might try to negotiate this way ( my another experience ):
- It was a great experience to interview with you, based on your expectation, if you can reduce it down a bit, we will hire you. Now, it's up to you about how much you can go down below.
Tip: If you really want to join that company and they ask you to reduce the expectation, you can take advantage of this for future use. I am ready to reduce up to this range but I want my salary to be reviewed every 6 months ( normally it is per year ). Who knows they agree?
I hope my experience will surely help you. If you have any questions, please comment down below.
