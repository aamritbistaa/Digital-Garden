1. **HTTP and HTTPS:**
   - **HTTP (Hypertext Transfer Protocol):** The foundation of any data exchange on the Web. It is a protocol used for transmitting hypertext and other data on the World Wide Web.
   - **HTTPS (Hypertext Transfer Protocol Secure):** The secure version of HTTP. It encrypts the data being transferred, providing a secure connection. It is widely used for secure data exchange, especially in e-commerce and sensitive transactions.
2. **URL (Uniform Resource Locator):**
   - A web address that specifies the location of a resource on the internet. It includes the protocol (e.g., http, https), domain name, and the path to the resource.
3. **HTML (Hypertext Markup Language):**
   - The standard markup language for creating web pages. It structures content on the web using elements, such as headings, paragraphs, links, images, etc.
4. **CSS (Cascading Style Sheets):**
   - Used for styling HTML documents. CSS defines the visual presentation of web pages, including layout, colors, fonts, and spacing.
5. **JavaScript:**
   - A programming language that enables interactive and dynamic content on websites. It is commonly used for client-side scripting to enhance user interfaces and handle asynchronous actions.
6. **Web Browsers:**
   - Software applications that retrieve and display content on the World Wide Web. Common browsers include Chrome, Firefox, Safari, and Edge.
7. **Web Servers:**
   - Software or hardware that serves content to users. Popular web servers include Apache, Nginx, and Microsoft Internet Information Services (IIS).
8. **DNS (Domain Name System):**
   - A system that translates human-readable domain names into IP addresses. It allows users to access websites using names instead of numerical IP addresses.
9. **Client-Server Architecture:**
   - The foundational model for web development. Clients (typically web browsers) request resources or services, and servers fulfill those requests.
10. **Cookies and Sessions:**
    - **Cookies:** Small pieces of data stored on the client's browser. They are often used for tracking user sessions and storing user preferences.
    - **Sessions:** A way to persist data across multiple requests. Sessions are often managed using server-side technologies.
11. **RESTful APIs:**
    - RESTful APIs are a way to interact with web servers using standard HTTP methods (GET, POST, PUT,UPDATE, DELETE).
12. **AJAX (Asynchronous JavaScript and XML):**
    - A technique used to create more dynamic and responsive web pages by making asynchronous requests to the server, allowing data to be loaded without refreshing the entire page.
13. **Web Security Concepts:**
    - **XSS** - injecting malicious scripts into a website(input) to harm its users.
    - **CSRF** is about tricking a user's browser into making unauthorized requests to a trusted website. Example: Imagine you are logged into your bank account, and without your knowledge, a malicious website you visit makes your browser send a request to transfer money from your account.
