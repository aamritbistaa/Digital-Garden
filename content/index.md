title: Digital Garden ðŸŒ±

Hello mate! This is me, Amrit Bista, and welcome to my digital garden.

This space is a curated archive of my study notes. I also include my medium blogs here which are free in medium. You can find me more on [medium](https://medium.com/@aamritbistaa).

Itâ€™s a growing repository where I document what I learn, break things apart, and put them back togetherâ€”sometimes better, sometimes just to understand them deeper.


This digital garden is my evolving map of knowledgeâ€”scattered, structured, and always growing. Feel free to explore! ðŸš€
