## Introduction to version control with Git
### Version Control
- Version control is a group of system and processes
	- to manage changes made to document, program and directories
- Version control is useful for anything that 
	- changes over time
	- needs to be shared
- Version control
	- tracks file in different stage
	- allows file development simultaneusly
	- combine different version of file
	- identify a perticular version
	- revert chages
### Git
- Git is a open source, scalable version control system for programming and data project
- Git stores everything
- Git notifies when there is conflicting content in files
- Git synchronizes across different people and computer
- Git commands are executed in shell
## Using the shell
- A shell 
	- is a program for executing commands
	- can be easily preview, modify or inspect files and directories
### Commands
- `pwd` - to display path of currently working directory
- `ls` - to display the list of directories inside of the current directory
- `cd [nameofdirectory]` - to change directory
- `nano [filename]` to add delete or change content of file
## Checking the version of Git
`git --version`
## Saving files
- REPO / repository contains:
	- files
	- directories
	- git storage (.git)
### Staging and commiting
- Staging a draft
	- staging area
- Save file/update the repo
	- commit change
### Acessing the .git information
- hidden
- contains all past information about the files
## Where does Git store information?
`.git` file
## The Git workflow
- Modify a file
- Save the draft
- Commit the update file
- Repeat
## Adding a file
`git add [filename]`
## Adding multiple files
`git add .` - adds add files and directories in current location
## Making a commit
`git commit -m 'Log Message'`
## Check the status of files
`git status`

## Comparing files
`git diff [filename]` 
![[4-  FinalNotes/Version Control/attachments/Pasted image 20230211125008.png]]
`git diff -r HEAD` - to compare all staged files with last commit
## What has changed?
## What's going to be committed?
## What's in the staging area?
